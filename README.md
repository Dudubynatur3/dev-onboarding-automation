#  Startup Developer Onboarding Automation

**Automated Linux user & group management for seamless developer onboarding on AWS.**  


---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project automates the onboarding of new developers on Linux servers hosted on AWS.  
Instead of manually creating users, groups, and permissions, this tool uses a **config-driven approach** to:  

- âœ… Automatically create users  
- âœ… Assign users to groups based on roles  
- âœ… Set directory and file permissions  
- âœ… Generate audit logs for transparency  

It is ideal for startups or small engineering teams, providing a fast, secure, and scalable onboarding process.
