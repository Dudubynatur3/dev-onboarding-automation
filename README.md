****                    Startup Developer Onboarding Automation**
This project automates the process of onboarding new developers on Linux servers hosted on AWS.
Instead of manually creating users, groups, and permissions, this tool uses a config-driven approach to:

✅ Create users automatically

✅ Assign users to groups based on roles

✅ Set directory and file permissions

✅ Generate audit logs to track all changes

It’s ideal for startups or small engineering teams that want a secure, fast, and scalable onboarding process.
