## 🎯 Project Overview

### The problem

Developer onboarding in growing teams is often:

* Manual and error‑prone
* Inconsistent across environments
* Difficult to audit and repeat safely

### The solution

This repository implements **automated developer onboarding** using:

* **Terraform** for repeatable AWS infrastructure provisioning
* **Production‑grade Bash automation** with:

  * `set -euo pipefail`
  * Idempotent state detection
  * Explicit validation and logging
  * Modular `bin/` + `lib/` architecture

The result is an onboarding system that is **safe to re‑run**, **auditable**, and **scales with team growth**.

---

## 🧠 Design Principles

This project intentionally demonstrates *how professionals write Bash in production*:

* **Fail fast** – no silent errors
* **Idempotent** – repeated runs converge to the same state
* **Declarative mindset** – detect and report state, not guess
* **Modular architecture** – reusable libraries, clean entrypoints
* **Portable** – no hard‑coded paths, user‑safe defaults

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### 1️⃣ Infrastructure Layer (Terraform)

* Provisions AWS EC2 instances
* Configures networking and access
* Handles repeatable environment creation

### 2️⃣ Automation Layer (Bash)

* Executable entrypoints in `bin/`
* Reusable logic in `lib/`
* Structured logging and validation
* Idempotent filesystem and user operations

### 3️⃣ Operational Guarantees

* Safe re‑execution (no destructive side effects)
* Explicit state reporting
* Predictable output for humans and automation

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧱 Modular Bash Architecture

```
bin/
  hello.sh          # Executable entrypoint
lib/
  logging.sh        # Structured logging utilities
  validation.sh     # Input validation and guards
  fs.sh             # Idempotent filesystem operations
```

* Clear separation of concerns
* Functions are testable and reusable
* Entry scripts remain minimal and readable

---

### ⚡ Fail‑Fast Safety

All scripts use:

```bash
set -euo pipefail
```

This guarantees:

* Immediate exit on error
* No use of undefined variables
* Pipeline failures are not hidden

---

### 🔁 Idempotent State Management

* Directories are created **only if missing**
* Existing state is detected and reported
* No‑op executions are explicitly logged

Example behavior:

```
[INFO] Directory '/home/user/projects' already exists — no action taken
[INFO] System already compliant — no changes required
```

---

### 📣 Structured Logging

All output follows a predictable format:

```
[INFO] ...
[ERROR] ...
```

This makes the scripts:

* Easy to debug
* Safe to integrate into CI/CD
* Suitable for audit and compliance review

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Clone and Run Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dudubynatur3/dev-onboarding-automation.git
cd dev-onboarding-automation

./bin/hello.sh
```

The script will:

* Validate input
* Ensure required directories exist
* Report whether any system changes were made

---

## 🚀 Terraform Deployment

This repository includes Terraform configuration for AWS provisioning.

### Core Terraform Files

* `main.tf` – EC2 and bootstrapping logic
* `provider.tf` – AWS provider configuration
* `variables.tf` – Configurable inputs
* `outputs.tf` – Deployment outputs

### Deploy Infrastructure

```bash
terraform init
terraform apply -auto-approve
```
