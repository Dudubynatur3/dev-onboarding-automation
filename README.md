## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project automates the onboarding of new developers on Linux servers hosted on AWS.  
Instead of manually creating users, groups, and permissions, this tool uses a **config-driven approach** to:  

- âœ… Automatically create users  
- âœ… Assign users to groups based on roles  
- âœ… Set directory and file permissions  
- âœ… Generate audit logs for transparency  

Ideal for **startups or small engineering teams**, providing a **fast, secure, and scalable onboarding process**.
