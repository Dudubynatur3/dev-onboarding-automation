## 🎯 Project Overview

**THE PROBLEM:** Startups hiring developers face a manual onboarding nightmare—creating user accounts, setting permissions, configuring environments, and ensuring security compliance for each new hire.

**THE SOLUTION:** This project automates the complete developer onboarding process using **Terraform (IaC)** and advanced Linux system administration. Onboarding time is reduced from **4–6 hours to ~10 minutes** with zero manual intervention.

### 💡 Real-World Business Value

- ⚡ Onboard 10+ developers simultaneously in under 15 minutes
- 🎯 100% consistent environments—eliminate "works on my machine" issues
- 🛡️ Built-in security compliance with automated audit trails
- 💰 Cost reduction: $150/developer → $5/developer in IT overhead

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Three-Layer Automation

**1️⃣ Infrastructure Layer (Terraform)**
- Provisions AWS EC2 instances with security groups
- Manages SSH key pairs and access policies
- Handles infrastructure scaling automatically

**2️⃣ System Administration Layer (Advanced Linux)**
- Complex user/group creation with custom UIDs/GIDs
- Advanced file permissions with ACL management
- SSH key generation and security configuration
- Home directory templates with development tools

**3️⃣ Compliance Layer (Automated Auditing)**
- System monitoring and security validation
- Automated compliance reporting
- Backup and recovery procedures

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Fully Automated Deployment

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Dudubynatur3/dev-onboarding-automation.git
cd dev-onboarding-automation

# Deploy everything with one command
terraform init
terraform apply -auto-approve

# ✅ Users created automatically in ~10 minutes
```

### Option 2: Step-by-Step Setup

```bash
# 1. Set up AWS credentials
aws configure

# 2. Generate SSH key pair
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/startup_onboarding

# 3. Update Terraform variables
vim terraform/main.tf

# 4. Deploy infrastructure
cd terraform
terraform apply

# 5. Verify user creation
ssh -i ~/.ssh/startup_onboarding ec2-user@<SERVER_IP>
sudo cat /etc/passwd | tail -10
```

## 🔧 Advanced Linux Commands

### User Creation and Management

```bash
# Create user with specific UID and primary group
useradd -u 2001 -g developers -m -s /bin/bash alice_dev

# Add user to multiple secondary groups
usermod -a -G sudo,docker,wheel alice_dev

# Set advanced ACL permissions
setfacl -m u:alice_dev:rwx /home/alice_dev/projects
setfacl -m g:developers:r-x /home/alice_dev/projects/team
```

### Security Configuration

```bash
# Generate SSH key pair with specific parameters
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f /home/alice_dev/.ssh/id_rsa -N ""

# Set proper SSH directory permissions
chmod 700 /home/alice_dev/.ssh
chmod 600 /home/alice_dev/.ssh/id_rsa
chmod 644 /home/alice_dev/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

### System Auditing and Validation

```bash
# List all users with UID >= 1000
awk -F: '$3>=1000 {print $1}' /etc/passwd

# Check group membership
getent group developers

# Find files with world-writable permissions
find /home -perm -002 -type f
